Data Collection
In first, the product is Airpods.
I tried for Airpods--any country --Detailed points(Title,Url,Source,Description,Ratings,Reviews,price.)
Using nodejs and Serpapi, i have started working on it.
Have took Airpods--then India for gl--10 pages avaliable in google--added conversion of Json to CSV format as result.
Output was 50 lines ----Detailes(Title,Url,Source,Description,Ratings,Reviews,price.)
Then changed some codes and tried again for India and US countries.
Output was 100 lines for both countries--Title,Url,Source,Description,Ratings,Reviews,price.
Serpapi makes some limitation for search and doesnt allow more than 100 results.
I have also tried for more than 5 countries, results same to 100 lines.
Then i have uploaded all the results in Drive folder and uploaded the code in git.
