Usually, we are not able to collect all the data, Therefore we take a sample for the study. After collecting the data it is very important to look at the condition 
of the data like the orientation of the data,trend of the data etc. Most of the statistical method adopted in any research has some assumptions about the 
distributions of the data for the test and these assumptions of tests are very important. if the data collected from field are violating the assumptions
for a particular test then the results we get may not be accurate.

What is Distribution? 
The distribution of a statistical dataset is the spread of the data which shows all possible values or intervals of the data and how they occur.

A distribution is simply a collection of data, or scores, on a variable.
Usually, these scores are arranged in order from smallest to largest and then they can be presented graphically.

Why are distributions important?
Sampling distributions are important for statistics because we make inferences about the population parameters based on the sample taken from it.
Hence distribution is necessary to make inferences about the overall population.
