Analyzing the underlying Distribution of Data is one of the most underrated steps when building a model. Understanding the data distributions is crucial for various
data analysis applications. The knowledge of distribution of data allows you to:
1.Identify outliers
2.Identify patterns and trends in the data.
3.Make predictions and conclude the population from which the data is drawn.
4.Evaluate the reliability of your findings by accounting for variability in the data.
5.Choose appropriate statistical tests and models that fit the distribution of your data.
By understanding the distribution of your data, you can ensure that your results are accurate, reliable, and valid.

It can also serve another function, one that is often overlooked by data scientists- Confirming your data collection systems. 
If you have ground truth about what your distribution is supposed to look like, checking your collected data distribution can help you identify both data drift and problems
in your collection systems. Both of these problems can slip under the hood and mess up protocols.Doing an analysis of the Data Distribution collected 
and comparing it to ground truth can be a great way to confirm that systems are working as they should.

Common Techniques to Analyze the distribution of data
1.Histograms
2.Boxplots
3.Q-Q plots
4.Descriptive statistics
5.Statistical tests

Common mistakes people make when analyzing the distribution of their data
1.Ignoring outliers
2.Dropping Outliers
3.Using the wrong statistical test
4.Not visualizing the data

Data distribution:
Data distribution is a mathematical function that describes the probability of different outcomes or values in a dataset. 
In other words, it tells us how the data points are spread out and how likely it is to observe a particular value.
There are two main types of data distributions:
1.Continuous Distributions: These describe the probabilities of all possible values within a continuous range,such as height, weight, or temperature.
                            In a continuous distribution, there's a probability associated with every point on the number line within the given range.
2.Discrete Distributions: Describe the probabilities of distinct, separate values, such as the number of heads when flipping a coin or the number of items sold in a store.
                          In a discrete distribution, the probability is associated with each distinct value, and the values are typically integers.
