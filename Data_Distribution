Analyzing the underlying Distribution of Data is one of the most underrated steps when building a model. Understanding the data distributions is crucial for various
data analysis applications. The knowledge of distribution of data allows you to:
1.Identify outliers
2.Identify patterns and trends in the data.
3.Make predictions and conclude the population from which the data is drawn.
4.Evaluate the reliability of your findings by accounting for variability in the data.
5.Choose appropriate statistical tests and models that fit the distribution of your data.
By understanding the distribution of your data, you can ensure that your results are accurate, reliable, and valid.

It can also serve another function, one that is often overlooked by data scientists- Confirming your data collection systems. 
If you have ground truth about what your distribution is supposed to look like, checking your collected data distribution can help you identify both data drift and problems
in your collection systems. Both of these problems can slip under the hood and mess up protocols.Doing an analysis of the Data Distribution collected 
and comparing it to ground truth can be a great way to confirm that systems are working as they should.

Common Techniques to Analyze the distribution of data
1.Histograms
2.Boxplots
3.Q-Q plots
4.Descriptive statistics
5.Statistical tests

Common mistakes people make when analyzing the distribution of their data
1.Ignoring outliers
2.Dropping Outliers
3.Using the wrong statistical test
4.Not visualizing the data

Data distribution:
Data distribution is a mathematical function that describes the probability of different outcomes or values in a dataset. 
In other words, it tells us how the data points are spread out and how likely it is to observe a particular value.
There are two main types of data distributions:
1.Discrete Distributions: Describe the probabilities of distinct, separate values, such as the number of heads when flipping a coin or the number of items sold in a store.
                          In a discrete distribution, the probability is associated with each distinct value, and the values are typically integers.
2.Continuous Distributions: These describe the probabilities of all possible values within a continuous range,such as height, weight, or temperature.
                            In a continuous distribution, there's a probability associated with every point on the number line within the given range.

Parameters of Data Distributions:
We use various parameters to describe the shape and characteristics of a data distribution. These parameters help us summarise the data and draw insights from it.
The most common parameters are:
1.Mean :it is also known as Average.It represents the central tendency of the data and can give you an idea of the "typical" value in the dataset.
        However, the mean can be sensitive to extreme values or outliers.
2.Median:The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean, making it a better measure of the central tendency for skewed distributions.
3.Mode:. The mode can be useful for understanding the most common outcome in a dataset, particularly in discrete distributions.
4.Variance: Variance measures the dispersion or spread of the values in a dataset.A higher variance indicates a greater spread of values,
            while a lower variance suggests the values are more tightly clustered around the mean.
5.Standard Deviation:It's a measure of dispersion that is expressed in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret than variance.
                      A higher standard deviation indicates a larger spread of values, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the values are more closely 
                      grouped around the mean.

Common Data Distributions Types:
Binomial Distribution
Characteristics:
The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials (independent experiments with two possible outcomes: success or failure). 
The distribution is characterised by the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p) in each trial.

Poisson Distribution
Characteristics:
The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate of occurrence (λ). 
The distribution is characterised by its single parameter, λ, which represents the average number of events in the interval.

Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
Characteristics:
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous distribution characterised by its symmetrical, bell-shaped curve. 
The curve is centred around the mean (µ) and is defined by its standard deviation (σ). Approximately 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 
95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
