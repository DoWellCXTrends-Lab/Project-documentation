Sample size
    -Sample size larger than 30 and less than 500 is appropriate for most research studies.
    -A minimum sample size of 30 for each subset.
    -In multivariate research sample size should be preferably 10 times or more as the number of variables in the study.
    -For simple experimental research with tight control (qualitative research), a sample size of 10-20 is adequate.
    -95% level of confidence (5% level of significance) is the accepted level in business research
   - if we know N and SD n = [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 / 1 + [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 * N]
   - if we know SD n=[Z2* p(1-p)]/e2]
   -Slovin's formula n=N/[1+Ne^2]
