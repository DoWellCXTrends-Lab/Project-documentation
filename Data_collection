Data collection or data gathering is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system

Project Title: 

Objective: The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive Customer Experience (CX) Index study 
to assess and analyze brand awareness, brand loyalty, customer journey, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
 
Design of the project: 50 Products
                       50 Countries
                       15 Ecom sites per country
                       100 Shops per Ecom site per hour

Step 1: Defining the Population
We define our target population as Infinite

Step 2: Determining Sample Size
To determine the appropriate sample size, we consider the following factors:

Desired Confidence Level: We aim for a 99% confidence level, 
meaning that we want to be 99% confident that the results accurately reflect the opinions of our entire population.

Margin of Error: We set a margin of error at ±5%, which indicates the maximum acceptable difference between the sample estimate and the true population parameter.

Population Size: Infinite

Sample size:- Roscoe’s (1975) guidelines
•	Sample size larger than 30 and less than 500 is appropriate for most research studies.
•	A minimum sample size of 30 for each subset.
•	In multivariate research sample size should be preferably 10 times or more as the number of variables in the study.
•	For simple experimental research with tight control (qualitative research), a sample size of 10-20 is adequate.
•	95% level of confidence (5% level of significance) is the accepted level in business research
•	if we know N and SD n = [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 / 1 + [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 * N]
•	if we know SD n=[z2* p(1-p)]/e2]
•	Slovin's formula n=N/[1+Ne^2]

Using the formula for sample size calculation for a infinite population:
 n = [Z2* p(1-p)]/e2]
Where:
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level
p = Estimated proportion of the population 
e = Margin of error
After calculations, the determined sample size is 666.

Step 3: Data Collection 
Data collection or data gathering is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system

Data Collection Plan:
Search engine rank (based on search, keyword......)
DoWell rank (based on consumer perpective)

Google search
Collecting 1000 results from all categories 
1)links(all)
2)images
3)videos
4)shopping
5)map
6)news

using the filter : Any time 
Data will be collect at every hour
here each data points consist of both the result(image,link..) and its ranked position

Data collection tools:
Specialized scraping tools and APIs are used for retrieveing search results.



Relevance of the <image/video/news/links/map/shopping> 
to create <Awareness/Knowledge/Liking/Preference/Conviction/Purchase> among consumers of <product>
