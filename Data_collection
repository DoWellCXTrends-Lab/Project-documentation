Data collection or data gathering is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system
How much data do we need for the Project?
Data is collected at Different levels:
1.	Universe
2.	Country wise Ecom site
3.	Shop level product
4.	Customer in a shop

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, events, or elements from a larger population with the intention of studying and making inferences 
about the entire population
•	Define the Population
•	Determine Sampling Method
•	Identify Sampling Frame
•	Determine Sample Size

At Universal level
	Suppose we are considering instant food as the product then at universal level there will be overall 1,91,00,00,000 results generated in google search,
if we are taking this as the population size, then this size will vary for different products , Also this results generated will not be random

Sample size:- Roscoe’s (1975) guidelines
•	Sample size larger than 30 and less than 500 is appropriate for most research studies.
•	A minimum sample size of 30 for each subset.
•	In multivariate research sample size should be preferably 10 times or more as the number of variables in the study.
•	For simple experimental research with tight control (qualitative research), a sample size of 10-20 is adequate.
•	95% level of confidence (5% level of significance) is the accepted level in business research
•	if we know N and SD n = [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 / 1 + [z2 * p(1-p)] / e2 * N]
•	if we know SD n=[z2* p(1-p)]/e2]
•	Slovin's formula n=N/[1+Ne^2]
