Hidden Markov Model  Algorithm
The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm can be implemented using the following steps:

Step 1: Define the state space and observation space
The state space is the set of all possible hidden states, and the observation space is the set of all possible observations.

Step 2:Define the initial state distribution
This is the probability distribution over the initial state.

Step 3:Define the state transition probabilities
 These are the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. This forms the transition matrix, which describes the probability of moving from one state to another.

Step 4:Define the observation likelihoods: 
These are the probabilities of generating each observation from each state. This forms the emission matrix, which describes the probability of generating each observation from each state.

Step 5:Train the model
The parameters of the state transition probabilities and the observation likelihoods are estimated using the Baum-Welch algorithm, or the forward-backward algorithm. This is done by iteratively updating the parameters until convergence.

Step 6:Decode the most likely sequence of hidden states
Given the observed data, the Viterbi algorithm is used to compute the most likely sequence of hidden states. This can be used to predict future observations, classify sequences, or detect patterns in sequential data.

Step 7:Evaluate the model
The performance of the HMM can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

To summarise, the HMM algorithm involves defining the state space, observation space, and the parameters of the state transition probabilities and observation likelihoods, training the model using the Baum-Welch algorithm or the forward-backward algorithm, decoding the most likely sequence of hidden states using the Viterbi algorithm, and evaluating the performance of the model.
