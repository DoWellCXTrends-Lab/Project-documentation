USING PYTHON -- TEXT EXTRACTION FROM IMAGE--

To extract the text from images i have used Google colaboratory
First i checked for the image condition, then checked ways for extracting text.
Written python code and inserted the URL of the image in the path.
I were able to get the text for images sucessfully.
But for small size images like in google search, if i search for buy instant food and in result page i could see the Title,description,link,sub-link and also Image.
If i open the image in a new tab, the image opens with smaller in size with similar to thumnail with 92*92 size.
If i try to extract the text from that image, it is able to detect the image but don't gives the result.
ISSUE----I have also checked for other small size images also which results same as empty text.
So im facing issue with text extraction in small images.
I have upload the code in Git as "Text extract from Image".
