USING PYTHON -- TEXT EXTRACTION FROM IMAGE--

To extract the text from images i have used Google colaboratory
First i checked for the image condition, then checked ways for extracting text.
Written python code and inserted the URL of the image in the path.
I were able to get the text for images sucessfully.
But for small size images like in google search, if i search for buy instant food and in result page i could see the Title,description,link,sub-link and also Image.
If i open the image in a new tab, the image opens with smaller in size with similar to thumnail with 92*92 size.
If i try to extract the text from that image, it is able to detect the image but don't gives the result.
ISSUE----I have also checked for other small size images also which results same as empty text.
So im facing issue with text extraction in small images.
I have upload the code in Git as "Text extract from Image".

we both have created a new file as Image Processing and updated the results for Color extraction from image and text extracted from image.
Also updated the code used to extract the data in Image processing.
11/9 currently working on Text extraction from image by google image search.
currently facing issue when i make a loop for all image urls to extract text.
