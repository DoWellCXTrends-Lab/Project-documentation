1.Sir, 
  In image positioning , 
  the  scale is given like -B  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 A 1 2 3 4 5 B .
  What is this -B and B. Is there any significance for giving it like that? 
  Can't we simply give the scale as -5 to 5 with image A in the center?
Reply: -B = - infinity, B= + infinity

2.Sir , is this the scale is example for one respondent or one gd? (Add Scale doc link)
Reply-One gd. Scales are for group. Not for individual

sub - so, the moderator is suppose to bring  all 5 ppt to come to one conclusion..
      or while analysis stat team will be compiling and deriving to one scale for one FGD
Reply- Moderator will take value to scale only. each scale represent groupâ€™ s opinion .
The scales are -BAB, -CAC, -CBC . moderator is not giving the value, group is giving.

3.Sir, Actually we are trying to ask, on what condition the group will give the position and moderator mark on the scale .
 Is we need to define the values -5 to + 5 in the scale? 
 or they can discuss about the images and then the moderator can mark on the scale. 
 the only question is should we need to define the values present in the scale?
Reply-no, we are learning from respondents how they are arriving the values. So we need not define
