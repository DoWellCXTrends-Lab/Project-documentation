Spearman's Rank Correlation

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, often referred to simply as Spearman's rho (ρ), 
is a statistical measure used to assess the strength and direction of the monotonic 
relationship between two variables

State the Hypotheses:

H0: There is no monotonic relationship between the two variables.
Ha: There is a monotonic relationship between the two variables.

Calculate the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (ρ):
Rank the data for both variables and then calculate the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

Calculate the Test Statistic:
The test statistic for Spearman's rank correlation is typically based on the calculated ρ value.
It is transformed to a value that follows a t-distribution under the null hypothesis. 
The formula for the test statistic is:

t = (ρ * sqrt(n - 2)) / sqrt(1 - ρ²)

Where:

ρ is the calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
n is the number of data points.

Determine the P-Value:
Using the calculated test statistic, you can determine the associated p-value from the t-distribution. 
The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, 
assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Make a Decision:
Compare the p-value to a pre-defined significance level (alpha), commonly 0.05.

Interpretation:
If you reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that there is a statistically significant monotonic 
relationship between the two variables. If you fail to reject the null hypothesis,
you don't have sufficient evidence to claim a significant relationship.


alpha:	0.05			
Coefficient(ρ)	-0.006535792717			
N:	50			
T statistic:	0.04528226738			
DF:	48			
P Value:	0.9640701875			
				
Since Pvalue > alpha				
There is no enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant monotonic relationship between the two variables.				
				

















INSTANT FOOD
definition :-Instant foods are convenience foods which require minimal preparation, typically just adding water or milk.
Some authors define "instant" food as requiring less than five minutes of preparation and "ultra-instant food" as requiring 
less than one minute.
