Target is to pick all the words from each row of snippet column and identifying as part of speech.
Using NLTK for identifying part of speech.

Problem facing:-
Getting issue with part of speech identification that most of the verbs and adjectives treating as noun.

Second idea:-
Stop using NLTK, getting a library having almost every adjective, verbs are there so making dictionary using that library then matching each words with the dictionary to identify.
Apart from those all are considered as a noun.


Problem resolved:-
NLTK is idntifying some adjective and verbs as a noun because these are in capitalized form. Change those to lower case then it identified accurate.

Next Step:-
-all text from all the search result, compare them
-check the noun, verb, adjective, pronouns in obsn 1st, 2nd, 3rd......
-no of characters, words, sentences, paragraph, font type, font size
-comparison- how to compare..
