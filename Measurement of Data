Scales of measurement is how variables are defined and categorised. Psychologist Stanley Stevens developed the four common scales 
of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Each scale of measurement has properties that determine how to properly analyse the data.
4 Levels of Measurement:
1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

Nominal: Used to categorize data into mutually exclusive categories or groups.

Ordinal: Used to measure variables in a natural order, such as rating or ranking. 
They provide meaningful insights into attitudes, preferences, and behaviors by understanding the order of responses.

Interval: Used to measure variables with equal intervals between values. This type of measurement is often used for temperature and time, 
allowing for precise comparisons and calculations.

Ratio: Allows for comparisons and computations such as ratios, percentages, and averages. Great for research in fields like science, engineering, 
and finance, where you need to use ratios, percentages, and averages to understand the data.
