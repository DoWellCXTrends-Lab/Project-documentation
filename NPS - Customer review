Main Task: Derive the formula for calculating NPS (Net Promoter Score):
NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors

Subtask: Derive the formula for calculating the count of both promoters and detractors.

Step 1: Collecting all possible keywords and categorize them into 3 groups: Promoters, Passive, and Detractors. Also, consider the reviews to extract keywords.

Step 2: Assign values for each group of words to determine the formula to find the count of promoters and detractors.

Step 3: Derive a formula based on the keywords and check it with the raw data to examine how accurate it is.

Step 4: Find errors and finalize the formula for calculating the count of promoters and detractors.

Step 5: Based on the previous steps, derive a formula for NPS using the count of promoters and detractors.


After categorizing the keywords into promoters, passives, and detractors, we can assign values as follows: 9 or 10 for promoters, 7 or 8 for passives, and 0 to 6 for detractors. We can then use the equation

 AX+BY+CZ/(X+Y+Z) = 0-10 to determine whether the review corresponds to a promoter, passive, or detractor.

To clarify the equation, let's break it down:
A represents the value of keywords that stand for 9 or 10 (we need to assign a particular value, either 9 or 10). If we randomly assign 9 or 10 to the keywords, the equation will have more variables.
X is the count of those keywords in a review for promoters (9 or 10).
B represents the value of keywords that stand for 7 or 8 (passives).
Y is the count of those keywords in a review for passives.
C represents the value of keywords that stand for 0-6 (detractors).
Z is the count of those keywords in a review for detractors (0-6).

By using this equation, we can determine the numerical value of each review and categorize it into promoters, passives, or detractors. Reviews with values in the range 0-6 will be classified as detractors, those with values in the range 7-8 as passives, and those with values in the range 9-10 as promoters. Consequently, we can count the number of promoters and detractors based on these numerical values obtained from the reviews. 
For example, consider the following review: "The blender is incredibly powerful and blends fruits and veggies effortlessly, but it tends to be quite noisy during operation, which can be annoying, especially in the mornings."

In this review, we categorize "incredibly" as a keyword for promoters with an assigned value of 10, "effortlessly" as a keyword for passive with an assigned value of 8, and "noisy" and "annoying" as keywords for detractors with an assigned value of 6.

Using the given values:
A (value for promoters) = 10, x (count of promoters' keywords) = 1
B (value for passives) = 8, y (count of passive keywords) = 1
C (value for detractors) = 6, z (count of detractors' keywords) = 2

When substituting these values into our equation, we get:
(10 x 1) + (8 x 1) + (6 x 2)  / (1+1+2) = 7.5

This means that the review is considered as passive based on the calculated value falling within the passive range (7-8) according to the assigned values.
