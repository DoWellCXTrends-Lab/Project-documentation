Not getting any data from Ecom sites using Scrapeops API therefore looking for some different methods nd API's.
Figuring out how to connect MongoDB database to the API's 
I was working on the automation process to analyze the image for one of the variables i.e. Quality of image.
I have uploaded my code, file name "Quality Analysis" been reading and learning about it in details as well.
The program has couple of errors right now but making some progresses and working on them.

I have been working on the errors i got yesterday in my code for flipkart
I have uploaded my code "flipkart_Products'

16/August
Getting the shop data from Flipkart, But the issue with flipkart is that it's layout is completely different from amazon it does not provide the product by shop.
Scrapeops was returnin empty files. 
We have decided to go by different approach i.e. to go get all the product data including the seller or shop name from search results and than we can group them by seller name.
Now i am working on the model to get the respective data.


14/august
working on the different API's to find out a desired results
Been getting empty json file as a result by scrapeops API 
Issue with the Automated methods is that getting blocked by the Ecom sites
Trying different methods and API's to resolve the issue
Uploaded my Selenium code as well "AmazonSeller"
Uploaded the scrapeops code as well "amazon_seller"

I have uploaded my code in the respective library under the name of SellerInfo
Working on the issues with the API i.e The API is getting the data sometimes and sometimes it is returning an empty string.
Got some more shop/seller urls and names to work on with and also waiting for gazal to provide more shop urls and details

Scrapeops API is having some issues to collect all the data working on the errors and preparing a new model from scratch
Also helping gazal with getting the consumer level data as we both are working with scrapeops
She having some trouble gettng the data, empty data set is being returned every time i was helping her in resolving the issue


I am working on scraping the data from the shop url but facing some error been working on them
I was using scrapeops API and python Scrapy libraries

Yesterday i was working on a road map on how to get to the shop site to get the shop level data
What data we need, variable
Gazal is working on the consumer level data from where she can scrap the shop name and shop url which i need to scrap the data
In the meantime i am working with the shops that i already have 


Created a new branch Review Scraper which contains the code to scrap the consumer lever reviews, name, date and time using Scrapy and scrapeops api



Scrapy is new topic to me hence it is taking more time to learn than expected
Mean while working with selenium 
There are limitations to selenium working on finding the solution to those limitations
Unable to jump from one page to another
Getting limited number of reviews
