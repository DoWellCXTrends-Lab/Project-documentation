I have uploaded my code in the respective library under the name of SellerInfo
Working on the issues with the API i.e The API is getting the data sometimes and sometimes it is returning an empty string.
Got some more shop/seller urls and names to work on with and also waiting for gazal to provide more shop urls and details

Scrapeops API is having some issues to collect all the data working on the errors and preparing a new model from scratch
Also helping gazal with getting the consumer level data as we both are working with scrapeops
She having some trouble gettng the data, empty data set is being returned every time i was helping her in resolving the issue


I am working on scraping the data from the shop url but facing some error been working on them
I was using scrapeops API and python Scrapy libraries

Yesterday i was working on a road map on how to get to the shop site to get the shop level data
What data we need, variable
Gazal is working on the consumer level data from where she can scrap the shop name and shop url which i need to scrap the data
In the meantime i am working with the shops that i already have 


Created a new branch Review Scraper which contains the code to scrap the consumer lever reviews, name, date and time using Scrapy and scrapeops api



Scrapy is new topic to me hence it is taking more time to learn than expected
Mean while working with selenium 
There are limitations to selenium working on finding the solution to those limitations
