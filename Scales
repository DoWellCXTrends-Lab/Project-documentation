Ordinal scale - Ranking scale, relative position according to certain attributes, not magnitude or difference

Interval scale - to rate the object such that numerically equal distances on the scale represents equal distance in the character being measured.  it includes all characters of nominal and ordinal scales in addition to difference in equal distance
