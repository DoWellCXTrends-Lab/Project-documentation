Object detection like logo are detected from image using opencv.
Yolov4 is one of the real-time object detection model that can recognize 80 different object classes.
First went through the documentation of Yolov4 and step by step process started as Clone repository.
Then installing darknet and connecting  Directory to Darknet.
Run Make-File to create Darknet executable.
Downloaded yolo4 Weights using https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights
Run ./Darknet Detector and Display Images.
!./darknet detector test cfg/coco.data cfg/yolov4.cfg yolov4.weights data/image7.jpg(At this point i faced issue with directory not found )
Then changed the file position %cd darknet/ using change directory.
As output i was able to get axies of the image.
I have uploaded the code i have used in Object detection File.
