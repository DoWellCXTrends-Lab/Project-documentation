DATA PREPROCESSING 
 There are two ways ranking the products on the basis of customer perspective.
1. Independent Ranking  2. Dependent Ranking
In independent Ranking we are measuring distance of (L/I/V/M/S/N) from consumer's ideal product's in L/I/V/M/S/N. whereas in Dependent ranking system 
we are measuring the distance of (L/I/V/M/S/N) from first result shown by the search engine in  L/I/V/M/S/N.
**L-Link,I-Image,V-Videos,M-Maps,S-Shopping,N-News

since it's difficult to find the consumer's ideal product in each category of Independent Ranking. we are considering the dependent Ranking system ie, we are
taking the first result shown by the search engine in each category as an ideal product.
STEPS WE DID:
dependency method
1. we considered Image category and supposed that there are 50 variables for an image.for image1,image2.....image13 we randomly generated some values between 1-100.
2.Here image1 is considered ideal.
3.checking the dependency of image1 with others using chi square dependency test.

CHI-SQUARE TEST
  The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. 
It helps us understand whether the observed distribution of categorical data differs from the expected distribution, assuming certain hypotheses.

Types of Chi-Square Tests
There are two main types of Chi-Square tests:
1)Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit: This test determines whether the observed frequency distribution of a categorical variable fits a theoretical distribution.
2)Chi-Square Test for Independence: This test investigates if there is a relationship between two categorical variables. It is often used to assess whether 
the proportions of one categorical variable are different across different levels of another categorical variable.
