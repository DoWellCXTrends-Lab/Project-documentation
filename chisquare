CHI-SQUARE TEST
  The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. 
It helps us understand whether the observed distribution of categorical data differs from the expected distribution, assuming certain hypotheses.

Types of Chi-Square Tests
There are two main types of Chi-Square tests:
1)Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit: This test determines whether the observed frequency distribution of a categorical variable fits a theoretical distribution.
2)Chi-Square Test for Independence: This test investigates if there is a relationship between two categorical variables. It is often used to assess whether 
the proportions of one categorical variable are different across different levels of another categorical variable.
