we have collected 50 instant food products images from Google images for our demo report.Here we are going to give
our ranking for the images based on the scores we are calculating from the images.
->The score will be based on the question "How relevant is this image for our product(instantfood)?".
->To calculate the relevance we need to find some variables which are making it relevant, for eg;brand,colors etc.
->Equal weights can be considered for all variables at the initial stage.
->we are finding a score in the range 0-100.

->why product images are so important?
-customers make an immediate value judgement based on the look and aesthetic of your product.Regardless of whether or not that's a fair assessment
of your product's quality.if onsumers aren't impressed by your product images right off the bat,they will likely choose not to purchase your product.

->what makes a good product image
 Most of the eye-catching products images share these characteristics:
-Focus is on the product(product is close up and takes up most of the image).
-Product is shown against white background.
-The image is very clear and high quality(>500x500).
**IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOWCASE YOUR PRODUCT AS IT WOULD APPEAR IN STORES.**

->what to avoid
-Images of anything other than your product.
-Grainy low-pixel photos
-Dark and Shadowy images
-Photos where the product only takes uo 1/2 or less of total image.
-Any words,logos or watermarks in your image (no edited text on or around the product).
-Image where the product is sideways or upside down
-Image of your product without its packaging if it is sold in packaging.
-Not enough pictures.
