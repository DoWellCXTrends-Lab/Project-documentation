{"asin": "B018AUYBW4", "text": "NOW, only Amazon sells this product at over 50% discounted price! So many times doubt, whether it's a rejected or sub standard quality? If so, it's illegal, as no FSSAI marked food products can be sold in sub standard or inferior quality.Ok, let's have a faith in Amazon, then it's a good product (taste varies a lot, using it for years!), at very good price, so go for it!One more point, the Company (MTR) manipulates the price. Just in little past, MRP was Rs 13, which is now Rs. 27!! So this may be Sales gimmick of the company also to offer it at a huge discounted price to Amazon on gross buying!
